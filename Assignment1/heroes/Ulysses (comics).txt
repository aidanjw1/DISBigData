The original Ulysses was much older than Walter Charles, his successor. When Ulysses became annoyed at [[Agamemnon (Pantheon)|Agamemnon]]'s illogical leadership decisions Agamemnon ordered fellow [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]] member [[Jason (Pantheon)|Jason]] to kill Ulysses. Jason refused and the task went to [[Achilles (Marvel Comics)|Achilles]] instead. Ulysses and his future successor Walter Charles went to save a young Nathan Taylor (aka [[Paris (Pantheon)|Paris]]) hoping to get to him before the Watts riots of 1959 began.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #408</ref> Up to that point Walter had always worked with his mentor Achilles but Agamemnon made a last minute switch to the orders ensuring that Ulysses would be too distracted by the riot to prevent himself from being shot by Achilles. Presumably Ulysses became a member of the Endless Knights like the rest of Agamemnon's deceased offspring but this has never been stated.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #411</ref>

[[Achilles (Marvel Comics)|Achilles]] lied to the rest of the Pantheon and said that Ulysses wanted Walter to take his place in the event that anything happened to him. Walter then assumed the mantle of Ulysses as his own.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #379</ref>

Ulysses seemed to have problems with several other members of the Pantheon. Paris hated him for letting his parents die in the Watts Riot. He and [[Hector (Pantheon)|Hector]] often argued about Hector's homosexuality. Jason hated him for plucking out his eye with the handle of a mop. His predecessor thought he was incompetent.

Ulysses had an infatuation with fellow Pantheon member [[Delphi (Pantheon)|Delphi]] who had the habit of almost always being naked and had sworn to remain pure of body. Achilles mentioned that Ulysses's love for Delphi springs from the fact that she is unattainable. Achilles mentions that Ulysses is afraid to challenge himself so he conveniently falls for a woman he can never get so he does not have to face the challenge of actually trying to win her heart.

Delphi left the Pantheon shortly before Agamemnon's death to stay with her mother Andromeda. After Agamemnon's death, Ulysses left the Pantheon to track down Delphi.

===Ulysses Cain===

At the start of the "[[Civil War II]]" storyline, Ulysses Cain is a normal person attending [[The Ohio State University]] with a student named Michelle. When the Terrigen cloud that was released in the aftermath of the "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline arrives at The Ohio State University, Ulysses and Michelle are affected as they both enter Terrigenesis; Michelle emerges as a red-skinned beast, while Ulysses develops precognition.<ref>''Civil War II'' #0. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Upon being discovered by [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] upon Ulysses running away from Ohio State University in a panic, he was brought to New Attilan where he was trained by [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]] into perfecting his precognition.<ref>''Civil War II: Ulysses'' #1-3</ref>

At the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], Medusa and [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]] introduce Ulysses to [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]], [[War Machine]], and [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]]. There, Ulysses has a premonition that the villain [[Thanos]] is coming to steal a [[Cosmic Cube]] from a Project Pegasus facility. The heroes take Thanos by surprise when he arrives at his destination, but She-Hulk is severely injured and War Machine is killed during the fight. Thanos is still defeated.<ref>''Free Comic Book Day 2016 Avengers''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After Ulysses reveals to the Avengers that he foresaw the invasion of the Celestial Destroyer, [[Iron Man]] protests the logic of stopping crimes before they occur, asking if they should lock people up because of what they ''might'' do, and leaves in frustration. Three weeks later, Iron Man arrives at the Triskelion and learns that [[War Machine]] died and [[She-Hulk]] was mortally wounded in battle with Thanos. When he learns that they used Ulysses' precognitive power to ambush Thanos, Iron Man vows to ensure that nobody uses it again.<ref>''Civil War II'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ulysses later has an encounter with [[Spider-Man]] upon being brought to [[Parker Industries]] to test his powers by Medusa and [[Human Torch]]. After being trained to use his powers the right way by working with him to stop a [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulturion]] attack and prevent a man killing his ex-girlfriend and her current partner, Spider-Man asks Ulysses if he has any visions about the future of Parker Industries. This prompts Ulysses to note that he sees ex-supervillain Clayton Cole returning to his [[Clash (comics)|Clash]] alias and attacking Spider-Man.<ref>''Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon Ulysses' latest vision, Spider-Man stops five criminals piloting the Quintronic Man and leaves them webbed up by the police. Ulysses advised Spider-Man to confront Clayton about his possible return to the Clash alias.<ref>''Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man's subsequent efforts to investigate the vision apparently provoked Clayton's return to his old role as Clash at the time he was approached by [[Mendel Stromm]].<ref>''Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Spider-Man accepts that everyone made mistakes rather than blaming Ulysses specifically for Clayton's descent, but decides that they need to watch how reliant they become on Ulysses' visions to prevent a similar experience in future.<ref>''Civil War II: Amazing Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ulysses later received a vision that tipped off [[Blue Marvel (Marvel Comics)|Blue Marvel]] about Infinaut's ninth manifestation attempt enabling him, [[Giant-Man]], and the Ultimates to work on a Pym Particle accelerator that ended up anchoring Infinaut and shrinking him down to human size.<ref>''Ultimates'' Vol. 2 #9</ref>

[[Modred the Mystic]] later visited Ulysses Cain while posing as Crystal in order to see if he has any visions for him. Modred tells [[Power Princess|Warrior Woman]] that the Myriad can be enhanced if they can get the Atlanteans on their side. First, Warrior Womam will have to resurrect [[Namor]].<ref>''Squadron Supreme'' Vol. 4 #9</ref>

Iron Man infiltrates New Attilan and takes off with Ulysses after defeating Medusa, Crystal, and [[Karnak (comics)|Karnak]]. After scolding Ulysses for his vision about Thanos leading to War Machine's death, Iron Man plans to study how Ulysses' precognition works. The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], the [[Ultimates (2015 team)|Ultimates]], the Inhumans, and other superheroes arrive to confront Iron Man about his actions. Before they can discuss it, Ulysses has a vision of a rampaging [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] standing over the corpses of the superheroes. Upon his powers enhancing, Ulysses projects the vision to everyone present which causes the younger Inhumans to weep.<ref>''Civil War II'' #2</ref>

During the Avengers-presided trial of [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] after he had killed Bruce Banner, Friday informs Iron Man that the analysis on Ulysses is almost complete.<ref>''Civil War II'' #3</ref>

Iron Man later meets with [[Captain America]], [[Black Bolt]], Medusa, [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], Captain Marvel, and [[Doctor Strange]] at the abandoned Funtime Inc. facility where he reveals the brain scan results on Ulysses. He tells them that Ulysses' power is based on probability calculations and not absolute truth. Captain Marvel is unpersuaded by Iron Man's discoveries and returns to the Triskelion.<ref name="Civil War II #4">''Civil War II'' #4</ref>

As the battle between Iron Man's side and Captain Marvel's side begins, Medusa tells Ulysses to stay in New Attilan. While meditating with Karnak, Ulysses' powers act up where it manifests as tendrils that wrap around the Triskelion as his eyes turn red. The vision shows [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]] at the capital holding the impaled body of Steve Rogers.<ref>''Civil War'' #5</ref> It is revealed that some of Ulysses' latest visions have been manipulated by Steve Rogers (now "reprogrammed" by [[Red Skull]]'s clone using Kobik's abilities to believe that he has been a Hydra sleeper agent for years)<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #2</ref> to prevent Ulysses from foreseeing his long-term plan for [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] by giving him more immediate "threats" to focus on, such as the possibility of Bruce Banner becoming Hulk again by anonymously delivering him gamma research information. Although Rogers acknowledges to Dr. [[Erik Selvig]] that Ulysses' latest vision suggests a new twist to this plan.<ref name="Captain America: Steve Rogers #5">''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #5</ref>

Ulysses later has a vision that takes him to an alternate future where [[Old Man Logan]] saves him from an unidentified grandchild of Hulk. Ulysses learns from him that the Inhumans have left Earth because of Iron Man pushing "her" too far. Upon coming out of the vision, Ulysses tells Medusa and Karnak that they need to confront Iron Man and Captain Marvel.<ref name="Civil War II #7">''Civil War II'' #7</ref>

During the battle between Captain Marvel and Iron Man, Ulysses has multiple visions of the entire Marvel Universe such as a [[Monsters Unleashed (comics)|fight between two groups of monsters]], the [[Inhumans vs. X-Men|Inhumans' fight with the X-Men]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] regaining his hammer. Ulysses appears before [[Eternity (comics)|Eternity]] where he evolves into a new being and even becomes one with the universe. Beast theories and explains to Captain Marvel that Iron Man fought her not because of a lack of trust in her. Because if Captain Marvel's method of profiling continued, it could be handled by untrustworthy people who would abuse Ulysses' power in the future.<ref name="Civil War II #8">''Civil War II'' #8</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Both Pantheon versions of Ulysses used an energy sword and shield as weapons.

Upon going through Terrigenesis, Ulysses Cain has precognition. However, the exact nature of this precognition is initially unclear, with Iron Man questioning what they should do if faced with the prediction of a hero doing something bad that they would not have done normally, rather than simply reacting to villainous assaults. His abilities enhance to the point where he projected the vision to anyone in range of him. According to Iron Man, Ulysses does not ''see'' the ''future'', but simply assembles vast quantities of data on a subconscious level and calculates the likelihood of certain outcomes taking place which he then projects as a vision.<ref name="Civil War II #4"/> Also, Steve Rogers and Dr. Erik Selvig have proven that Ulysses' ability appears to respond to bigger, more immediate threats rather than more distant ones, prompting them to prevent him from foreseeing their long-term plans for Hydra by creating more immediate problems for him to predict.<ref name="Captain America: Steve Rogers #5"/> He also has the ability to see into different timelines, such as the one where [[Old Man Logan]] resides.<ref name="Civil War II #7"/> During the final battle between Captain Marvel and Iron Man, Ulysses powers further evolve so much that he becomes omniscient, showing events that are in the future and even evolves into a higher plane of existence on which he can see Eternity and becomes one with the universe.<ref name="Civil War II #8"/>
