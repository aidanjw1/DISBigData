"[[Captain America]]" is the name of several [[fictional character]]s appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The first, and main, character was Steve Rogers, who was created by [[Joe Simon]] and [[Jack Kirby]]. Other characters have adopted the alias over the years and following Rogers' [[comic book death|death]] his former sidekick [[Bucky Barnes|James Buchanan Barnes]] (Bucky) picked up the mantle. Late 2010s storlines have his sometime crime fighting partner [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson]] assuming the role.

==Earth-616==
===Steven Rogers (Revolutionary War Era)===
'''Captain Steven Rogers''', the 18th century ancestor to the World War 2 [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] serum recipient.  He wore a colorful costume same as his descendant and carried a round cast iron shield as shown in ''Captain America: Sentinel of Liberty'' #6 (March 1999). But Revolutionary War Rogers acted as such before the USA existed formally as an independent country.  Thus, while addressed as "Captain America", Revolutionary War Rogers is largely not considered part of the formal line.

===Steve Rogers===
{{main article|Captain America}}
Steve Rogers was a scrawny Army reject who was given the [[supersoldier|Super-Soldier]] serum, becoming the only complete success for [[Weapon Plus|Project: Rebirth]], and the first formal person to be termed as "Captain America" as created and controlled by the Marvel Universe USA government.

===Isaiah Bradley===
{{main article|Isaiah Bradley}}
<!-- Commented out: [[File:IsaiahBradley.jpg|thumb|Isaiah Bradley]] -->
As depicted in the 2003 [[limited series]] ''[[Truth: Red, White & Black]]'', the World War II [[Weapon Plus|Super Soldier program]] of 1942, which used [[African American]] test subjects to re-create the formula that had been used to turn Steve Rogers into [[Captain America]]. The clandestine experimentation that empowered Isaiah held similarities with the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QrW9kmCAZQQC&pg=PA54#v=onepage&q&f=false Comics as Philosophy] p. 54</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2J7DpUItEMC&pg=PA498#v=onepage&q&f=false Encyclopedia of comic books and graphic novels, Volume 2] by M. Keith Booker, p.498</ref>
