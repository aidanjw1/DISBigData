"[[Spider-Man]]" is the name of multiple comic book characters from the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]]. The original and most well known is [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]] originating from the [[Earth 616]] universe. Within the mainstream [[Marvel Universe]] there have been other characters that have taken the mantle such as [[Ben Reilly]] and [[The Superior Spider-Man|Doctor Octavius]].

Outside of the mainstream universe, there are different incarnations of Spider-Man in alternate universes such as [[Ultimate Spider-Man|the Ultimate universe version]]. Originally, these characters were depicted as separate from each other, but they have crossed over together in ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', where the many versions of Spider-Men are the major protagonists of the storyline. Some of these characters were later merged in [[Battleworld|the same universe]] in the 2015 comic book series ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' as a part of the Spider-Man family.

==Earth-616==
{{Main|List of incarnations of Spider-Man}}
Peter Parker, the Spider-Man of [[Earth-616]] is the main incarnation of the character and appears in nearly every single piece of other media surrounding Spider-Man.

==Other universes==
Other related characters exist in [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternative versions]] of the [[Marvel Universe]] called the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]]. These characters originally appeared in their own continuity but later on crossed over with the mainstream Spider-Man family. In 2015 all the  alternate comic book universes were destroyed and only a few characters joined together with [[Earth-616]] characters in [[Battleworld|its own universe]] including various Spider-Men.

===DC Crossovers===
In the intercompany crossovers with DC Comics, Spider-Man has worked alongside [[Superman]] twice, once to defeat Dr. Octopus and [[Lex Luthor]] and the other to stop Doctor Doom from providing the [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]] with long-term access to the power of the Hulk and [[Wonder Woman]]. He also worked alongside [[Batman]] to defeat Carnage and the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]], the two later collaborating to defeat the Kingpin and [[Ra's al Ghul]], with Fisk eventually aiding the heroes in the end.

===Earth X===
In the series ''[[Earth X]]'' and its sequels, Peter Parker is no longer a superhero and during the course of the series becomes a police officer. Three other related characters appear:

===Exiles===
In the series ''[[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]]'', which involves inter-dimensional travel, several alternative versions appear:
* '''The Spider''' is an alternative version of Spider-Man who merged with the [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage-symbiote]] and has become a psychopathic killer. Before being displaced in time, he had been on death row in his home reality.<ref>''Exiles'' #12</ref> He originates from Earth-15 and was a member of [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)#Weapon X|Weapon X]].
* A Spider-Man who is a member of the [[Fantastic Four|Fantastic Five]] dies in a battle against The Spider.<ref>''Exiles'' #20-22</ref>
* A Peter Parker is part of a mutant super hero team, [[X-Force|Force-X]], led by [[Emma Frost]]. His codename is "Spider". His outfit is the standard Force-X uniform and he wears goggles instead of a mask. Also, his webbing is organic.<ref>''New Exiles'' #9-10</ref>
* A version of Peter Parker exists, who is a child abused by his [[Uncle Ben]]. While locked in the cellar, he is befriended by a large spider-like creature, the Tallus instructs [[Blink (comics)|Blink]] and [[Nocturne (comics)|Nocturne]] to lead this universe's incarnation of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] to the run down shack the Parkers call home, a fight ensues and the creature and Wolverine are both slain, as Blink and Nocturne depart this reality, it is shown that the creature bit the young Peter.<ref>''X-Men Unlimited'' #41</ref>
* Morph fought a Demon Spider-Man on an alternative world. Later, the Demon Spider-Man was viewed briefly by Mojo and Major Domo as it attacked a young couple in a parking complex, but Spider-Man killed himself.<ref>''Exiles'' #8 (March 2002)</ref>

===House of M===
In the "[[House of M]]", a Marvel [[fictional crossover|crossover]], the [[Scarlet Witch]] alters reality to make mutants the ruling class over humans. This world is ruled by [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutants]] and their leader, [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]. In the mini-series ''[[Spider-Man: House of M]]'', Peter Parker is believed to be a mutant, and Spider-Man's identity is widely known. He is rich, famous and married to Gwen Stacy, and they have a young son named Ritchie. Aunt May and Uncle Ben are alive and in good health, and J. Jonah Jameson is Peter's often-abused publicist. Unfortunately, his life unravels when Jameson reveals to the world that Spider-Man is not a born mutant. After the world is restored to normal, Peter suffers terribly with the memory of the life he left behind, expressing a desire to kill Magneto, whom he mistakenly believes was behind the events of House of M, and the Scarlet Witch, whose powers were responsible for the altered reality.<ref>''House of M'' #7 (2005)</ref> This version is later killed by Karn during the Spider-Verse event.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===The Manga===
{{Main|Spider-Man: The Manga}}
'''''Spider-Man: The Manga''''' is a [[Japan]]ese [[manga]] illustrated by [[Ryoichi Ikegami]] which retold the story of Spider-Man in a Japanese setting. It was originally published in Japan from January 1970 to September 1971 in ''Monthly Shōnen Magazine''. The main character is named {{Nihongo|Yu Komori|小森ユウ|Komori Yū}} to maintain the Japanese adaptation.

The [[Marvel Mangaverse]] is a comic book universe which was set in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|Multiverse]] created by [[Ben Dunn]]. The universe's  incarnation of Peter Parker debuted in ''Marvel Mangaverse: Spider-Man'' (2002) the first of a five-part mini-series,  which was created, written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.newsarama.com/446-remembering-when-west-has-met-east.html | title=Remembering When West Has Met East | publisher=[[Newsarama]] | date=16 July 2008 | accessdate=26 July 2015 |author1=Ong, Benjamin |author2=Kean Pang }}</ref> Andrews depicted this version of Spider-Man as a ninja and the last of the Spider Clan after his [[Uncle Ben]] was killed by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]].<ref name="Transnational">{{cite book|last1=Denson|first1=edited by Shane|last2=Meyer|first2=Christina|last3=Stein|first3=Daniel|title=Transnational perspectives on graphic narratives comics at the crossroads|date=2013|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=1441161465|edition=1. publ.}}<!--|accessdate=26 July 2015--></ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Suárez-Orozco|first1=edited by Marcelo M.|last2=Qin-Hilliard|first2=Desirée Baolian|title=Globalization culture and education in the new millennium|date=2004|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520930967}}<!--|accessdate=26 July 2015--></ref><ref name=Marvel>{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Brett|title=Welcome to Spider-Verse: 10 Alternate Reality Spider-Men|url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/23216/welcome_to_spider-verse_10_alternate_reality_spider-men|website=Marvel.com|publisher=[[The Walt Disney Company]]|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Jason|title=Manga : the complete guide|date=2007|publisher=Del Rey Books|location=New York|isbn=0345485904}}<!--|accessdate=26 July 2015--></ref> The character is the third depicted [[manga]] version of Spider-Man after ''[[Spider-Man: The Manga]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man J]]''.<ref name="Transnational"/>

The Mangaverse [[Spider-Man]] first appeared in the first series (created, written and drawn by [[Kaare Andrews]]) where his origin was very different from the regular Marvel Spider-Man.  In the Mangaverse Peter Parker is the last member of the Spider Clan of [[ninja]]s and has been taught martial arts by his [[sensei]], [[Uncle Ben]]. After Ben's murder by [[Venom (comics)|Venom]], an underling of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]], Peter starts to train in secret so he will be strong enough to exact his revenge. In this version of Spider-Man, [[May Parker|Aunt May]] is Peter's mother's sister instead of Uncle Ben being his father's brother. The Mangaverse Spider-Man was brought back for his own mini-series (again written by original creator Kaare Andrews) in which he encounters a cybernetic version of the [[Black Cat (comics)|Black Cat]], as well as the Venom symbiote. This symbiote does not become Venom and has mystical origins and connections to an 'evil' clan of Ninja who are affiliated with Spiders, apparently a counterpart to Spider-Man's own ninja clan. [[Norman Osborn]], better known as the [[Green Goblin]], has a minor appearance in the series.

In ''New Mangaverse: The Rings of Fate'', references are made to both the death of Captain America and in the ''Spider-Man: Legend of the Spider Clan'' miniseries which introduced his black costume and the Mangaverse Black Cat. During the course of this series, Spider-Man develops the unexpected ability to shoot webbing, which surprises him entirely. He is also the object of affection for both the Black Cat (though she later turns out to have been in league with the Mangaverse [[Nick Fury]], her true loyalty unknown), and Mary Jane Watson, who becomes the Mangaverse version of Spider-Woman, and is shown to be being trained by Peter in the ways of the Spider-Clan.

Unlike in the mainline Marvel Universe where Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Felicia Hardy are now adults, all three of them are in their early to mid-teens at this point, and possibly their mid-to-late teens by the time of New Mangaverse. This version of Spidey has wrapped gloves, a backpack emblazoned with the spider symbol, and tennis shoes.

The Mangaverse incarnation later appears in the crossover comic book storyline entitled [[Spider-Verse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nerdist.com/marvel-debuts-spider-verse-event-featuring-every-incarnation-of-spider-man/|title=Marvel Debuts SPIDER-VERSE Event Featuring Every Incarnation of Spider-Man|work=Nerdist}}</ref><ref name="Lowes">{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=51683|title=Dan Slott Unveils "Spider-Verse," Featuring "Every Spider-Man Ever" - Comic Book Resources|work=comicbookresources.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=57237|title=SPIDER-MANDATE: The Debut of "Spider-Woman," Importance of Tie-Ins - Comic Book Resources|work=comicbookresources.com}}</ref> He was one of the starred characters in the [[anthology]] comic book ''Spider-Verse'' #1 starring in the story "Spider Clan: The Many" continuing the Marvel Mangaverse series that starred him before. The story is written by [[Skottie Young]] and [[Jake Andrews]].  Jesse Schedeen of [[IGN]] explained that despite that "fans of the Mangaverse Spider-Man will be pleased to see that Peter Parker return", he expressed  Kaare Andrews not returning as unfortunate and also expressing disappointment with the new writers. He felt that Young "goes through a lot of effort in sending Peter on a journey to confront his heritage, only for it not to matter much in the end." He also compared it as ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]''-lite than being truly manga-inspired.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/13/spider-verse-1-review|title=Spider-Verse #1 Review|work=IGN}}</ref> Meanwhile, comic book writer [[Nick Lowe]] complimented their work calling it "great".<ref name="Lowes"/>

During the [[Spider-Verse]] crossover event, Mangaverse Spider-Man also appears teaming up with SP//dr, [[Spider-Man J]], and [[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)|Mecha Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (vol. 3) #12</ref> Jesse Schedeen praised that scene, describing as one of the highlights of the comics book issue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/amazing-spider-man-12-review|title=Amazing Spider-Man #12 Review|work=IGN}}</ref>

Shane Denson of ''Transnational Perspectives on Graphic Narratives: Comics at the Crossroads'' was negative on the mini-series starring the comic book character feeling that it didn't offer enough transnational and transcultural themes unlike the other manga series starring Spider-Man. He also compared it to ''[[Star Wars]]'' with Uncle Ben being much like [[Yoda]], Spider-Man being like [[Luke Skywalker]] and Venom being like [[Darth Vader]] with him being revealed as Spider-Man's cousin.<ref name="Transnational"/>

*The Marvel Mangaverse's Spider-Man suit appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]''. It is an alternate costume for [[Ultimate Spider-Man]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Henry|title=Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions' alternate costumes revealed|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/spider-man-shattered-dimensions-alternate-costumes-revealed/|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=26 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/video_games/13567/spider-man_shattered_dimensions_alternate_costumes_revealed|title=Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions Alternate Costumes Revealed - Spider-Man Games - News - Marvel.com|work=marvel.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gilbert|first1=Henry|title=Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions and the origins of its alternate costumes|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/spider-man-shattered-dimensions-and-the-origins-of-its-alternate-costumes/|website=[[GamesRadar]]|publisher=Future plc|accessdate=30 July 2015}}</ref>

===Marvel Adventures===
This version of Spider-Man first appeared in ''[[Marvel Adventures Spider-Man]]'' #53-#61 before appearing in the re-titled ''Spider-Man: Marvel Adventures'' comic book series. A modern-day high school student, this Spider-Man's origin is similar to his mainstream counterpart, but his supporting cast is significantly different. Although Gwen Stacy exists in this universe, she and Peter are not dating—instead Peter is dating a brand-new character named [[Sophia "Chat" Sanduval]], who is a mutant with the ability to talk to animals. Peter's relationship with Gwen's father Captain George Stacy also differs from the original version—here, Captain Stacy discovers Peter's secret identity early on, yet rather than hide this information from Peter (as his mainstream counterpart did), he confides in Peter and becomes Spider-Man's unofficial police contact. While this Spider-Man battles super villains, he is generally more concerned with combating street-level crime and focuses heavily on taking down the Torino Family, a powerful New York City mob.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===MC2===
An alternative version of Peter Parker also exists in the [[Marvel Comics 2]] (MC2) universe, appearing as a supporting character in [[Spider-Girl]].

The title follows almost the entire original timeline of the character up until the first attempt at a "relaunch" by the company, 1999, where it deviates and provides an alternative ending to the ''[[The Gathering of Five and The Final Chapter|Final Chapter]]'' storyline. Peter's wayward daughter May is revealed to be alive and well, and is returned to both Parkers by Peter's first clone, the redeemed Kaine. Despite now being a father, Peter continues to fight crime as Spider-Man, and begins to cope with the new responsibilities brought by his baby daughter.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Two years later, during his final battle against the Green Goblin, rather than survive unscathed, Peter loses a leg to his arch-enemy and Osborn is killed.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Peter finally realizes the price he has paid for being Spider-Man, and ends his career to raise a family with Mary Jane and May. Over the years, he overcomes his physical handicap and ultimately joins the NYPD in a scientific capacity. However, after saving him from an insane [[Normie Osborn]], his daughter May "Mayday" Parker begins a career as Spider-Girl behind his back, a decision Peter begrudgingly is forced to accept and deal with, made difficult by his love for May.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Regardless of his handicap, Peter returned to the role of Spider-Man several times. Once was to aid his daughter and [[Darkdevil]], the son of [[Ben Reilly]], against Kaine, another to convince the latest Spider-Man (the son of [[Jessica Drew]]), to cease risking his life, and in the 100th issue of the Spider-Girl title to save May from the Hobgoblin. Peter and MJ ultimately have a second child, [[Benjamin Richard Parker|Benjamin "Benjy" Parker Jr]], who is temporarily rendered deaf after possession by the Carnage symbiote and being blasted with high-frequency sonics. Benjy later develops powers of his own at an infant age.{{issue|date=February 2013}} Peter was killed by Daemos, the brother of [[Morlun]], during the [[Spider-Verse]] event while trying to protect Benjy and Mayday.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

====Spider-Girl====
{{Main|Spider-Girl}}
The ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' comic book series, originally published under the [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] [[imprint (trade name)|imprint]], features May "Mayday" Parker, Peter's daughter in an alternative [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|continuity]]. This timeline diverged from [[Earth-616|regular continuity]] when Peter and Mary Jane's daughter is returned to them by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]]. In ''Spider-Girl'', Peter has been retired from crime fighting since his final battle with the Green Goblin, which cost him a leg. Peter has settled down to family life and works for the [[New York City Police Department]] as a [[forensics|forensic scientist]]. His teen daughter May follows in his footsteps against his wishes, but Peter eventually helps her train for her calling. Peter appears in costume several times in ''Spider-Girl'', either to restrain and protect May, or to assist her. Peter is among the superheroes kidnapped by Loki in the spin-off ''[[Last Hero Standing]]''.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the recent Spider-Girl storyline "Brand New May", Peter has uncovered a lab, within it is a stasis tank containing an exact physical duplicate of Mayday Parker, with notes left behind by Norman Osborn suggesting she is the real Mayday, and not a clone. When protecting his nephew Normie from an exploding test tube, Peter is affected by the serum within much like Osborn was...and begins to develop erratic behavior. He ultimately overcomes an attempt by Norman Osborn to control his mind and defeats him with the aid of his daughter, her clone, and the spirit of his Aunt May.

In the same [[Marvel Comics 2|MC2]] continuity as Spider-Girl, Gerald "Gerry" Drew, the son of [[Spider-Woman (Jessica Drew)|Jessica Drew]], inherits spider-powers and poses as Spider-Man. Created by [[Tom DeFalco]] and [[Ron Frenz]], he first appeared in ''[[Spider-Girl]]'' #32 (May 2001), and is a supporting character of ''Spider-Girl''.

Within the context of the stories, Jessica Drew, the original Spider-Woman, had retired from super heroics, and gotten married. She gives birth to a baby boy, Gerry, who was diagnosed with a strange blood-borne disorder due to radiation exposure in the womb. With doctors and medicines unable to help her son, Jessica recreates the experiment that cured her of her radiation poisoning, the experiment that made her Spider-Woman. The experiment imbues Gerry with spider-like powers, but did not cure him. Gerry's illness strains his parents' marriage and leads to their divorce. Feeling responsible for the break-up, Gerry becomes withdrawn. Jessica tries to alleviate his pain by telling him stories from her past, his favorites involving Spider-Man.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Determined to make his short time on Earth count, Gerry designs his own Spider-Man costume and equipment based from his idol's, and convinces his mother to train him in how to use his powers. Calling himself Spider-Man, he meets Spider-Girl, and the two initially clash.<ref>''Spider-Girl'' #33</ref> During a fight between several villains, a bullet intended for Spider-Man kills one of the villains when Spider-Girl shoves him out of its way. Upset that he was responsible for a death, Gerry runs into [[Darkdevil]], who trains him to be a more effective crime fighter. At the request of Peter Parker, the original Spider-Man, Gerry decides to retire from super heroic adventuring while [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] searches for a cure for his blood disease.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects (comics)|Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]'' series, set in Earth-50701, Spider-Man was abducted by an alien scientist name [[Niles Van Roekel|Doctor Niles Van Roekel]]. [[Thing (comics)|The Thing]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], [[Human Torch]], and [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] are also abducted and injected with a drug in an attempt to corrupt them. Once infected Spider-Man's costume is brown-and-bronze with a blue spider mark in his chest. Spider-Man and the other heroes are eventually able to fight off the corrupting infection and defeat Van Roekel. In the aftermath of the invasion, Paragon and the Imperfects join together to share the Earth with the heroes.<ref>''Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects'' #1-6</ref>

===''Mutant X''===
The ''[[Mutant X (comics)|Mutant X]]'' version of Spider-Man diverges from his mainstream counterpart in [[The Six Arms Saga|''Amazing Spider-Man'' #102]], in that he was unable or unwilling to cure himself of having six arms. For unexplained reasons, he reverses his name to Man-Spider. A third divergence occurs when he and his clone continue to coexist after the end of the original [[Clone Saga]]. The two keep this a secret by taking care to never appear in public at the same time,<ref>''Mutant X'' #6 (March 1999)</ref> but "Man-Spider" is forced to admit the truth after his clone is killed by [[Madelyne Pryor]].<ref>''Mutant X'' #5 (February 1999)</ref> He himself is later killed.<ref>''Mutant X'' #32</ref>

===Newspaper strip===
The Peter Parker of the daily Spider-Man newspaper strip continues his career as a struggling photographer constantly facing down the abuse of his less-than-satisfied boss J. Jonah Jameson, whilst battling crime in his disguise as Spider-Man. In addition to opposing classic enemies, much of the strip sees Peter battle new enemies. He has also teamed up with various heroes through the strip's run, such as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He is married to Mary Jane in this continuity, and has often been aided by her in his battles with his enemies. This universe was visited by [[Morlun]] during the [[Spider-Verse]] event, but due to time distortions constantly resetting things so that the simplest actions take weeks to progress, Morlun finds his efforts to consume this version of Peter fruitless. The Master Weaver of the Inheritors elects to rebel against his masters for once and seals this universe away in a pocket dimension where it will remain safe from any further attacks.<ref name="sv1">''Spider-Verse'' #1 (2014)</ref>

===''Powerless''===
Marvel published a limited series called ''[[Powerless (comics)|Powerless]]'' in 2004, which tells how the Marvel Universe would be without super-powers. In this series, Peter Parker appears as a young man nicknamed '''Spider-Man''' on the internet. This version had also been bitten by a radioactive spider, but instead of getting super-powers his hand became atrophic. In this continuity, Peter is in love with Gwen Stacy; Mary Jane is not featured.<ref>''Powerless'' #1-6</ref>

===Spider-Pig===
Marvel allowed Fox's show [[The Simpsons]] to have a pig dressed as Spider-Man with a theme song parodying the one from the original show.

===''Ruins''===
[[Warren Ellis]]' parody of [[Kurt Busiek]]'s ''[[Marvels]]'', ''[[Ruins (comics)|Ruins]]'', was a two-part miniseries set in an alternative universe where the situations that led to the heroes of the Marvel Universe gaining superpowers instead led to the more realistic side effects of horrific deformities and deaths. In this world, when Parker was bitten by a radioactive spider, instead of gaining powers, he broke out into an infectious rash that covered his body before his painful death. He had visited the offices of the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' beforehand and infected fellow photographer Phil Sheldon, who set off to figure out how his world took a wrong turn, but succumbed to the disease before he could write his book.

===Spider-Boy===
In the [[Amalgam Comics]] continuity, Spider-Man was combined with DC's [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] to create [[Spider-Boy]]. He was featured in ''Spider-Boy'' #1 (April 1996) and ''Spider-Boy Team-Up'' #1 (June 1997). In this continuity, Spider-Boy is the clone of researcher [[Peter Parker]], created during an explosion in the Project Cadmus Labs. Adopted by Cadmus director General [[Thunderbolt Ross]], he is given the name "[[Pete Ross]]". Spider-Boy's power is the ability to redirect his own personal gravity, giving him the ability to climb walls, and to increase his strength. He is able to shoot webs using a special "Web Gun" developed by Cadmus. Spider-Boy is an honorary member of the Legion of Galactic Guardians 2099 (an amalgamation of DC's [[Legion of Super-Heroes]] and Marvel's [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]] plus the [[Marvel 2099]] timeline).

===Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures===
{{Main|Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures}}
The [[United Kingdom]] based [[Panini Comics]] publication ''Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures'' was loosely based on the continuity of the [[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|1990s animated series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/series/36705|title=Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures|publisher=Grand Comics Database}}</ref> In the series Peter Parker deals with the day-to-day headaches of balancing a social life with his super-heroics. He has a close circle of friends such as Liz Allen, Harry Osborn, and Flash Thompson, and he is involved in a relationship with Mary Jane. However, in this continuity, Mary Jane does not possess an existing knowledge of his dual identity, and thus Peter finds juggling his life with her and his crime-fighting career difficult. Despite this, Mary Jane loyally supports Peter, believing it is his dangerous job as a photographer that keeps him away from dates and other activities. A look into the future reveals Peter and MJ ultimately get married in this continuity, and have a daughter, May, who is active as Spider-Girl. At some point in this future, Peter loses his leg, which forces him to retire as Spider-Man.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man Adventures'' #1-185 (1995-2005)</ref>

===Spider-Man 1602===
Peter Parquagh is a counterpart to Peter in the miniseries ''[[Marvel 1602]]'', albeit without powers. In the series he acts as an apprentice to the royal spymaster Sir Nicholas Fury. A running gag involves Peter repeatedly almost getting bitten by unusual spiders, something that finally occurs at the very end. In the sequel, ''[[1602: New World]]'', he takes the identity of the Spider. Later, Peter's dual identity is revealed, and with the death of his beloved [[Virginia Dare]] at the hands of [[Norman Osborne]], he returns to Europe and falls in love with Marion Jane Watson and joins her family of theater performers. During a battle with Baron Octavius, Norman Osborn, and Curtis Connors in Venice, a bystander picks up some of Peter's webbing which eventually served as the basis for the Super Soldier Serum and created Captain America in World War II in this universe.<ref>''1602: New World'' #1-4 (2005)</ref> While in the Globe theatre, he is attacked and killed by the super villain Morlun.<ref>''Guardians of the Galaxy'' Free Comic Book Day Special (2014)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/21333-marvel-promises-some-wild-things-from-edge-of-spider-verse.html|title=Marvel Promises Some 'Wild Things' From EDGE OF SPIDER-VERSE|publisher=Newsarama|date=12 June 2014}}</ref> Spider-Man 1602 appears in ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'' as an alternative costume for Spider-Man Noir, and in ''Edge of Time'' as a costume for Miguel O'Hara.

===Spider-Man 2099===
{{Main|Spider-Man 2099}}
A [[Genetics|geneticist]] named Miguel O'Hara gained his spider-like powers from a gene-splicing incident, when the company he was about to quit injected him with a dangerous drug called Rapture. He tried to rid himself of the drug by using the Gene Slicer he helped to invent, but unbeknownst to him a jealous co-worker had set it to repeat the previous experiment of a spider. The last time they had tried this experiment it killed the test subject (the main reason Miguel O'Hara quit), but this time it worked. Instead of becoming a company owned version of Spider-Man he became the opposite, a Spider-Man to fight Alchemax and the other large corporations ruling the world in 2099. He now fights crime as the Spider-Man of 2099.<ref>''Spider-Man 2099' #1-3 (1992)</ref>

He is a playable character in the video games ''[[Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', with ''Edge of Time'' seeing him pitted against a psychotic version of Peter Parker in 2099, this Peter having become the CEO of Alchemax and attempting to rewrite the universe to fit his vision. CEO Peter uses an elaborate spider-based robot in his fight against Miguel, but Miguel is able to defeat him by using the tentacles of Atrocity- a twisted hybrid of [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Doctor Octopus]], and Alchemax employee Walker Sloan- to weaken CEO Peter's powers.

Pavitr Prabhakar debuted in ''[[Spider-Man: India]]'', a comic book that originally published in India by [[Gotham Entertainment Group]] in 2004, retelling the story of Spider-Man in an Indian setting.<ref>''Spider-Man: India'' #1-4</ref>

Pavitr Prabhakar, a simple Indian boy from a remote village, moves to [[Mumbai]] with his Aunt Maya and Uncle Bhim to study after getting half a scholarship. His parents died some years ago. Other students at his new school tease him and beat him for his studious nature and simple background. He knows his Uncle Bhim is struggling to support him and his aunt Maya, and pay his school fees. Only Meera Jain, a popular girl from his school, befriends him. Meanwhile, a local [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] named Nalin Oberoi uses an amulet to perform an ancient ritual in which he is possessed by a [[demon]] committed to opening a gate for other demons to invade Earth. While being chased by bullies, Pavitr Prabhakar encounters an ancient [[yogi]] who grants him the powers of a [[spider]], in order to fight the evil that threatens the world. While discovering his powers, Pavitr Prabhakar refuses to help a woman being attacked by several men. He leaves the place, but comes back when he hears his uncle cry out, and discovers that he has been slain. He learns that Bhim was stabbed when he tried to help the woman. Pavitr Prabhakar understands that with great power comes great responsibility, and swears to use his powers for the good of others.

Nalin Oberoi briefly becomes human again and transforms a mild-mannered [[Physician|doctor]] into a demon with four magical tentacles (the Indian version of Doctor Octopus), and sends him to kill Spider-Man, as instructed by the demon voices. "Doc Ock" fails, and Spider-Man makes his public debut as a hero. He is, however, labeled a threat by the newspapers.

Oberoi kidnaps Pavitr Prabhakar's aunt, taking her to a refinery outside Mumbai. There he betrays Doctor Octopus, blasting him into the ocean with a ray. Spider-Man arrives and fights Oberoi, who has also kidnapped Meera. He drops both Maya and Meera from the top of the refinery. Spider-Man dives for his aunt, but fails to rescue Meera, who is saved by Doctor Octopus. Pavitr reveals his identity to Meera and asks her to take his aunt to safety.

Oberoi gets rid of Doctor Octopus for good and touches Spider-Man with the amulet. A [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]-like creature emerges from the amulet tries to lure Spider-Man to the dark side. Pavitr remembers his uncle's saying about responsibility and rejects the evil. By doing so, the link between the demons and Oberoi is shattered, and he becomes human again. Spider-Man throws the amulet into the ocean, and Oberoi is sent to a mental institution.

Peace is restored to Mumbai eventually. Pavitr Prabhakar begins a romance with Meera, and is shown celebrating the festival [[Diwali]] with his aunt. The story ends with a quote from the [[Bhagavad Gita]], showing the Venom-Demon still alive.

During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Pavitr Prabhakar was seen fighting a mysterious new villain named Karn, whom he mistook for a demon. [[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) managed to save him and recruited him into his army of Spiders.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32</ref> In the second volume of ''Spider-Verse'' set during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, Pavitr Prabhakar found himself in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia, where he teamed up with [[Spider-Gwen]], [[Spider-Ham]], [[Marvel Noir#Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man Noir]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]], though none of them remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.

Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref name="bleedingcool.com">http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/</ref>

Pavitr Prabhakar is playable among other Spiders in the [[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|''Spider-Man Unlimited'' video game]].

====Ultimate Peter Parker====
''Ultimate Spider-Man'' is a modernized [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]] of the Spider-Man story, starting from the very beginning, with a plot that is inspired by, but very different from, the original continuity, and thus is a parallel universe counterpart to the mainstream version of Spider-Man. The main purpose of the series is to be accessible to new and young readers, as it is free from the decades of history of the original, but it has been embraced by many longtime fans as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', [[Ultimate Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] is a high-school student who is bitten by a spider during a school field trip—but instead of a radioactive spider (which reflected the [[Atomic Age]] in which Spider-Man's origin was written), it is a lab subject that has been [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] by [[Green Goblin|Osborn Industries]].{{issue|date=February 2013}} The themes, characterization, and setting are updated to reflect modern life.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It is set in the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

This Spider-Man also appears along Amazing, Noir, 2099 Spider-Men in the game ''[[Spider-Man Shattered Dimensions]]'' wearing the black symbiote suit.

His costume bears an orange-and-purple color as opposed to red-and-blue. The Spider once claimed that he was a clone made from the DNA of Spider-Man and Professor X that was sent from the future. In the "Death of Spider-Man" story arc, "Avengers vs. New Ultimates", he is revealed to be North Asian and under the orders of Gregory Stark. He led a superhuman uprising in North Korea.<ref>''Ultimate Avengers vs. New Ultimates'' #5</ref> During the events of said uprising, The Spider was killed by Hawkeye after the Avengers and the New Ultimates intervened.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
