'''Hector''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as a member of the [[superhero]] family the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]]. Hector uses an energy [[flail (weapon)|flail]] as a weapon. Hector appears to be something of a master strategist.

==Fictional character biography==
Hector is openly gay, which doesn't seem to be a problem for anyone in the family aside from [[Ulysses (Pantheon)|Ulysses]]. Ulysses and Hector often argue about Hector's homosexuality. Ulysses once suggested that gays brought the AIDS crisis on themselves by being too promiscuous, which led to Hector punching him to spare a lengthy and pointless argument.{{issue|date=April 2013}} At another point, Ulysses harasses Hector over a friendly conversation he has with known gay superhero [[Northstar]].{{issue|date=April 2013}} Hector often has to fight off the unwanted sexual advances of fellow Pantheon member [[Cassiopea (Pantheon)|Cassiopea]].{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Hector often goes on Pantheon missions, including unofficial ones such as helping the Hulk avenge the murder of an old Las Vegas mobster friend.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Later, Ulysses sacrifices himself to save Hector.{{issue|date=April 2013}} When asked why he would die for someone he hates, Ulysses answers that busting each other's chops is what brothers do.{{issue|date=April 2013}}

Nothing is known about Hector's life prior to joining the Pantheon. He made the comment that he was recruited into the Pantheon 30 years ago.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #401</ref> One of the lower level technicians at the Pantheon made the comment that Hector is the biggest gossip in the group.{{issue|date=April 2013}}
