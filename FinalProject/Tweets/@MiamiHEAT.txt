@menacethedj @MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 Straight up for Marc Gasol, Bam at the 4
@alley_way_ @DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT @ThisIsUD It’s worth a shot
@SrMayo1 @MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 He's a liability on the court right now. I want to see us win.
@menacethedj @MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 We need Whiteside to do well to up his trade value
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 He's our most promising player and should get KOs minutes
@chrisbosh @MiamiHEAT @cavs You are one of the greats of the game CB @chrisbosh WE MISS U! Thanks for the Miami memories
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 let start him for awhile better than nver
@DwyaneWade @MiamiHEAT @ThisIsUD Do your thing, but come back home when you're done!
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 Seeing as how Whiteside doesn't care, how about we start Bam?
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 the other being Winslow's 5/5 vs MIN.
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 YEEEESSSSS!!!!! LETS GET IT!!!!! HEATNATION BABY!!!!!!!!
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 Stop having him sitting the bench for weeks clearly he should be in the rotation every damn night
@MiamiHEAT where is @Bam1of1 poster at Wade?
@MiamiHEAT @Bam1of1 Trade Whitesides bum ass.
@chrisbosh @MiamiHEAT @cavs You’ll ALWAYS be a part of us, CB!
