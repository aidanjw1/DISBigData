@RobVelazAyala @ibrycent @Lakers We still would of gotten kuzma without thst 27th pick bc the nets aren't interested in kuzma.
@richardfrias @Lakers Luke has bad rotations
Nance gets a lot of turnovers
Lonzo is soft
And brook Lopez is possibly washed.
@richardfrias @Lakers All of the above
@Lakers He getting MIPOTY ( Most Improved Player of the Year)
and @Lakers loss

@NBA @HoustonRockets @Lakers Harden plays so easy
@SerenaWinters I hate to say it but with it each game the @lakers lose, it may be a step closer to Luke Walton losing his job 🤷🏾‍♂️
@sgbennett93 @Lakers Fuck me that’s a horrible stat line, he won’t be in the NBA in 4 years.
@Lakers Ingram gonna be a problem👊🏿

@Lakers @TheCoreyBrewer Salute!
Trade Larry Nance Jr.
@Lakers @MagicJohnson #NBA Nance Jr and Brook Lopez for Marc Gasol. Do it.
@Lakers He's the player the Lakers need, but not the one they deserve right now (see all the earlier bust talks).
@White_Mamba88 @Lakers I didn't think so I'm actually a fan of Ingram's
@Lakers Let Lonzo comes from the bench. He cant shoot and defend. Make Lavar mad as hell. Give a chance to JC or Caruso. Enough of the hype!
@Lakers this product is unacceptable.    4+ years of bad play, bad coaching, bad signings, no direction, nothing.
