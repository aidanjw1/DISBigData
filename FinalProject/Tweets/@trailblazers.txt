@trailblazers Best sports twitter account ever.
@blazer_believer @trailblazers CJ and Dame are low-key two of the best athletes on Twitter (and I'm assuming that's who you're referring to)
There seems to be a misconception regarding if a @trailblazers fan has a right to be critical of the players online… https://t.co/m86j3JSU3j
@trailblazers This is stupid
@AuggieFord @OGJailBlazer @trailblazers Because they’re used to being told how great they are and can’t handle any bit of criticism. Soft.
@trailblazers I’m blocked by Andrew Bogut and Trey Lyles but not by Meyers Leonard? I’m actually shocked.

@enRichD1 @b_a_loon81 @PlanetPat5 @trailblazers Welcome to the club bruv 😂
@trailblazers The replies on this tweet did not go like you planned Kris.
@trailblazers I said he fouls like a rookie. I wasn't lying.
@OGJailBlazer @trailblazers Bad take. What value is there in unsolicited criticism from randos?
@trailblazers That's because he sucks at basketball and can't handle criticism 🤷🏼‍♀️
@realbryanmead @trailblazers And to you, extra points for being the second person to deliver a fantastic and fitting burn.
@b_a_loon81 @trailblazers BURN. Extra points for that one! 😂

@trailblazers If you aren’t blocked by Meyers, it’s likely you aren’t honest with him!

@OnyxIllusionzz @trailblazers This is his salary https://t.co/XwhCUzquFo
@OnyxIllusionzz @trailblazers I don’t fucking know but it’s close to $10M and he shouldn’t even be getting $1M
@b_a_loon81 @PlanetPat5 @trailblazers @MeyersLeonard11 is soft. Can we get cash considerations for him?
@wellfuckmebitch @trailblazers How much we pay Leonard
@trailblazers But me tho, i was seriously one of the few that was actually a fan of his game and him!! Him blocking me musta been a mistake
@trailblazers because he's 7 feet tall?
@OnyxIllusionzz @trailblazers What
@trailblazers Meyers likes my tweet(s) 🤷🏻‍♂️
@trailblazers Stotts: Meyers you gotta block more if you want playing time! 

Meyers: Got it coach! https://t.co/gsyiqiCE0a
@trailblazers how do we not have one of these for Blaze? #RipCity https://t.co/JYH782Dj0b
@trailblazers He hasn’t blocked me but I also don’t hate all over him.
