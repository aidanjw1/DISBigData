@chicagobulls Really good to see @KrisDunn3 continuing to have strong games. Cheering for him.
@chicagobulls So how many more losses before we get relegated?
@chicagobulls We needed that loss against the Suns tho. Unfortunately. But all in for the #1 pick!
@Victori46198863 @chicagobulls @NBA Good for you, don't start watching again when they get good.
