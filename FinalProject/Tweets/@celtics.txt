@jackct15 @celtics That's why Celtics now aren't dominating as they did during the win streak... its coz of jalen
@jackct15 @celtics I don't know... he looks like he is not as motivated. He does look aggressive... he isn't taking too many attempts.
@Matthew40215230 @celtics @FirstTake @RealSkipBayless Yes GSW was the last game that he played well... after that, its been down hill...
@GethinCoolbaugh @celtics @WWE @RealMickFoley Its great to see him BACK....RIGHT HERE IN THE BOSTON GARDEN *nods head, thumbs up*
