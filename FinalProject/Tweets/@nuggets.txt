@shawnishandsome @nuggets Donovan is going to be a big time star.  Denver got fleeced.
@Ihatethisugh1 @nuggets Hopefully he can be good cause Mitchell has already become a starter for jazz and he‚Äôs performing very well

@Ihatethisugh1 @nuggets Did you guys get a draft pick together with trey?
@Ihatethisugh1 @nuggets Which doesn‚Äôt happen often does it the fact that there is Kenneth Faried
@shawnishandsome @nuggets Around 4 points and 2.5 boards a game.  When he plays.
@RHenry23 @nuggets It could have been worse.  The Nuggets could have drafted Sam Bowie and Greg Oden.
