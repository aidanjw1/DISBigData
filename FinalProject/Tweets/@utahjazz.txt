@jwclaws21 @pall0tta @utahjazz @tribjazz Maybe a Harrison Barnes? I can’t think of anyone else that available.
@pall0tta @jazzman_utah @utahjazz @tribjazz What they really need is a starting caliber athletic 3-D wing.
@pall0tta @jwclaws21 @utahjazz @tribjazz I hope you’re right. Do you think the Cavs are better than last years version?

@jazzman_utah @utahjazz @tribjazz False. Love is a shooting 4, he doesn’t make any plays.
