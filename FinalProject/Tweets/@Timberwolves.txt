@milbhatguy @Timberwolves @NewEraCap Too bad. Nice logo.
@Interstate19 @Timberwolves @NewEraCap We have their G league team here in Des Moines.  Sadly they don't do 5950 caps.

@Timberwolves no ball movement, no energy, no 3 pt shooting, no joy, no elegance....Thibs has successfully assembled the anti-Warriors
@Timberwolves Me: it‚Äôs not possible for a team to run iso offense for 48 straight minutes. Timberwolves: hold my beer.
@Timberwolves serious question, does Thibs have any idea what he is doing with these rotations for the poorly constructed roster?
