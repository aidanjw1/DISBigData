He first appeared in the episode "[[Paradise Lost (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Paradise Lost]]" where Daisy Johnson and Lincoln Campbell ask him about the Kree device in his possession. In the episode "[[The Singularity (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Singularity]]," James goes through [[Terrigen Mist|Terrigenesis]] at the hands of [[Hive (comics)|Hive]] and receives his power that enables him to charge things up for a fiery explosion. After being swayed to Hive's side, James assisted him, Daisy Johnson, and Alisha Whitley into abducting [[Holden Radcliffe]] in order to make their own Inhumans. During the final battle against Hive, Hellfire was defeated by Melinda May. In the episode "[[Let Me Stand Next to Your Fire]]," Hellfire was shown working at a fireworks store when Daisy Johnson and Jemma Simmons arrive to warn him about the Watchdogs. When meeting with Hellfire at a storage unit next to the fireworks store, the Watchdogs arrive where Hellfire mentioned to Daisy and Jemma that he struck a deal with the Watchdogs where he will help him dispose of the Inhumans in exchange that they kill him last. As Daisy and Jemma work to get away from the Watchdogs, Hellfire corners them until [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] shows up. Upon Phil Coulson and [[Al MacKenzie]] arriving to save Daisy and Jemma, Robbie becomes Ghost Rider and fights Hellfire. Upon the fireworks store exploding, Robbie drags Hellfire's body out of the explosion as he asked Coulson if he said to leave him alive. Jemma puts her hand against Hellfire's neck and nods up and down to Coulson.
