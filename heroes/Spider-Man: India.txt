'''''Spider-Man: India''''' is a [[comic book]] originally published in [[India]] by [[Gotham Entertainment Group]] in 2004, retelling the story of [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Spider-Man]] in an Indian setting. It ran for four issues, which were later also published in the [[United States]] in 2005 and collected into a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] ({{ISBN|0-7851-1640-0}}). The series was created by [[Sharad Devarajan]], Suresh Seetharaman, and Jeevan J. Kang with Marvel Comics. The Indian version was conceptualized by Indian director Satyajit Ray, who had once met Stan Lee in New York to discuss creating an Indian version of the superhero. However, this was not done during his lifetime.

This reality is designated as Earth-50101.

==Plot summary==
Pavitr Prabhakar, a simple Indian boy from a remote village, moves to [[Mumbai]] with his Aunt Maya and Uncle Bhim to study after getting half a scholarship. His parents died some years ago. Other students at his new school tease him and hit him for his studious nature and village background. He knows his Uncle Bhim is struggling to support him and his aunt Maya, and pay his school fees. Only Meera Jain, a popular girl from his school, befriends him. Meanwhile, a local [[Boss (crime)|crime lord]] named Nalin Oberoi uses an amulet to perform an ancient ritual in which he is possessed by a [[demon]] committed to opening a gate for other demons to invade Earth. While being chased by bullies, Pavitr Prabhakar encounters an ancient [[yogi]] who grants him the powers of a [[spider]], in order to fight the evil that threatens the world. While discovering his powers, Pavitr Prabhakar refuses to help a woman being attacked by several men. He leaves the place, but comes back when he hears his uncle cry out, and discovers that he has been slain. He learns that Bhim was stabbed when he tried to help the woman. Pavitr Prabhakar understands that with great power comes great responsibility, and swears to use his powers for the good of others.

Nalin Oberoi briefly becomes human again and transforms a mild-mannered [[endocrinologist|doctor]] into a demon with four magical tentacles (the Indian version of Doctor Octopus), and sends him to kill Spider-Man, as instructed by the demon voices. Doc Ock fails, and Spider-Man makes his public debut as a hero. He is, however, labeled a threat by the newspapers.

Oberoi kidnaps Pavitr Prabhakar's aunt, taking her to a refinery outside Mumbai. There he betrays Doctor Octopus, blasting him into the ocean with a ray. Spider-Man arrives and fights Oberoi, who has also kidnapped Meera. He drops both Maya and Meera from the top of the refinery. Spider-Man dives for his aunt, but fails to rescue Meera, who is saved by Doctor Octopus. Pavitr reveals his identity to Meera and asks her to take his aunt to safety.

Oberoi gets rid of Doctor Octopus for good and touches Spider-Man with the amulet. A [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]-like creature emerges from the amulet and tries to lure Spider-Man to the dark side. Pavitr remembers his uncle's saying about responsibility and rejects the evil. By doing so, the link between the demons and Oberoi is shattered, and he becomes human again. Spider-Man throws the amulet into the ocean, and Oberoi is sent to a mental institution.

Peace is restored to Mumbai eventually. Pavitr Prabhakar begins a romance with Meera, and is shown celebrating the festival [[Diwali]] with his aunt. The story ends with a quote from the [[Bhagavad Gita]], showing the Venom-Demon still alive.

==Parallels with Western Spider-Man==
Spider-Man's alter ego in the comic is named '''Pavitr Prabhakar''', a phonetic distortion of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]]. There are a number of other parallels with the original comic book characters:

* '''Meera Jain''' - She is analogous to [[Mary Jane Watson]].
* '''Auntie Maya''' - She is analogous to [[Aunt May]].
* '''Uncle Bhim''' - He is analogous to [[Uncle Ben]].
* '''Nalin Oberoi''' - Nalin Oberoi is a local [[Boss (crime)|crime boss]]. He is analogous to [[Norman Osborn]] and transforms into a demon reminiscent of the [[Green Goblin]].
* '''Hari Oberoi''' - Hari Oberoi is analogous to [[Harry Osborn]]. He did not appear, but was mentioned by Doctor Octopus.
* '''Aadi''' - Aadi is analogous to [[Eddie Brock]]/[[Venom (comics)|Venom]].
* '''[[Doctor Octopus]]''' - A mild-mannered doctor who Nalin Oberoi transforms into a demon with four magical tentacles.

==Later comic appearances==
During the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'' storyline which featured Spider-Men from various alternate realities, Pavitr Prabhakar was seen fighting a mysterious new villain named Karn, whom he mistook for a demon. [[The Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Peter Parker's body) managed to save him and recruited him into his army of Spiders.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #32</ref> In the second volume of ''Spider-Verse'' set during the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' event, Pavitr Prabhakar found himself in the domain of the [[Battleworld]] called Arachnia, where he teamed up with [[Spider-Gwen]], [[Spider-Ham]], [[Marvel Noir#Spider-Man Noir|Spider-Man Noir]], [[Captain Britain Corps|Spider-UK]] and [[Anya Corazon]], though none of them remembered their previous encounter during the original ''Spider-Verse''.

Following the conclusion of ''Secret Wars'' the team of six Spiders that formed during the event will rename itself and feature in a new ongoing series called ''Web Warriors'', a name that was coined by Peter Parker from the [[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|''Ultimate Spider-Man'' TV series]] during the original ''Spider-Verse''.<ref>http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/06/29/spider-gwen-stars-in-web-warriors-launched-by-mike-costa-and-david-baldeon-marveloctober/</ref>
