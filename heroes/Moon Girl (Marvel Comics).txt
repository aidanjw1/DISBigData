She has since gone on to be an increasingly popular character.

==Publication history==
The character was created by Brandon Montclare, [[Amy Reeder]] and Natacha Bustos and first appeared in ''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #1 (January 2016).

The genesis of the character came from Mark Paniccia and Emily Shaw who were a fans of the character Devil Dinosaur and had hired Montclare and Reeder to pen the basis for a new series that involved the character ending up in modern day. They came up with the idea of Devil Dinosaur interacting with a girl and fell in love with the idea of working with a hero who wasn't a "regular cape-and-tights superhero". Reeder explains the primary inspiration for the creation of the character:

{{quote|So she was just, originally this character who was kind of like [[Inspector Gadget]], but a little less campy—a little more knowing what she’s doing? You know, having gadgets come out of her backpack or whatever, and rollerskating around the city and solving crimes kind of things. And she was black. And then [Marvel] said a girl—the only difference was I made her younger, and that made her even cooler. She’s somebody who’s kind of awkward, a bit off the beaten path and people are not aware of her.}}

They also viewed the series as a direct sequel to the ''Moon-Boy and Devil Dinosaur'' series from [[Jack Kirby]] hence the first villains that Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur face are the Killer-Folk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-moon-girl-and-devil-dinosaur-became-one-of-marvels-1739466468|title=How Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur Became One Of Marvel's Biggest (And Cutest) New Comics|last=Whitbrook|first=James|website=io9|date=October 29, 2015|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>

Artist Natacha Bustos, found the character a relief from the norm of other typical superheros. She was primarily inspired by the clear diversity that ''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' promoted, further comparing the character Lunella to herself. She compared her story to a "[[Studio Ghibli|Ghibli]] one" due to the immense relationship between the title characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsbeat.com/interview-natacha-bustos-reveals-the-secrets-behind-moon-girl-devil-dinosaurs-gorgeous-art/|title=INTERVIEW: Natacha Bustos Reveals the Secrets Behind MOON GIRL & DEVIL DINOSAUR’s Gorgeous Art|last=Arriaga|first=Pablo|website=Comics Beat|date=June 22, 2016|accessdate=September 10, 2017}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Lunella Lafayette is a young African-American girl who daydreamed and loved to invent. Despite possessing an astoundingly large intellect, she is unable to get into better schools and attends Public School 20 Anna Silver. Her classmates make fun of her and dub her Moon Girl because of these qualities. One day, Lunella becomes obsessed with learning about the [[Kree]] and discovers an Omni-Wave Projector thanks to a device she invented. Her teacher Coach Hrbek accidentally activates the machine and opens a portal that brings in a group of tribal creatures called the Killer-Folk. They were followed by the [[Devil Dinosaur]] who was looking to avenge the death of his longtime partner [[Moon-Boy]].<ref>''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #1</ref> Lunella encountered Devil Dinosaur and suddenly formed a bond with him. She revealed that she found out she was a NuHuman and had feared the upcoming [[Terrigen Mist]] and had hoped the Kree technology could protect her. Her Omni-Wave Projector gets stolen by the Killer-Folk. Due to a bad encounter with [[Amadeus Cho]]' Hulk form, Lunella is separated from Devil Dinosaur.<ref>''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #2-4</ref>

Lunella's parents forbid her from after school activities, misinterpreting her interaction with Devil Dinosaur, but suddenly becomes determined to help her new friend. After gaining access to her secret lab hidden underneath P.S. 20, she dons a homemade costume and rescues Devil Dinosaur from the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. They then team up on the Killer-Folk and retrieve the Omni-Wave Projector, but it fails to protect her from the Terrigen Mists and she is enveloped in a cocoon. Devil Dinosaur takes her back to the lab to protect her.<ref name="MoonGirl1">''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #5-6</ref> She emerges days later, but can't seem to find anything wrong with her.

After a confusing day, she manages to set everything to normal.<ref name="MoonGirl2">''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #7-8</ref> Mel-Varr, donning the name Captain Kree, attacks Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur resulting in city damage.

==Powers and abilities==
Lunella Lafayette's primary gift is her advanced intelligence. She is dubbed the "smartest person in the whole world" by Amadeus Cho, making her smarter than other geniuses in the Marvel Universe such as [[Hulk (comics)|Bruce Banner]], [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]], [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]] and Cho himself.<ref>''Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur'' #12</ref> She uses her intelligence to build a wide variety of gadgets that she uses in battle. Her "battle armor" consists of boxing headgear, goggles, suspenders, a computerized utility belt, backpack, some minor weapons (notably her spring powered boxing glove), and a special pair of roller-skates.<ref name="MoonGirl1" />

As a result of her [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] heritage, Lunella possesses the ability to switch consciousness with Devil Dinosaur whenever she is angry or extremely hungry. Due to her intelligence, she is also capable of speech while in the body of the dinosaur. However, her regular body takes on a feral like personality due to Devil Dinosaur having taken over.<ref name="MoonGirl2" /> She also possesses some manner of enhanced strength, but according to Captain Kree it is radically insignificant compared to her other abilities.<ref name="MoonGirl3" />
