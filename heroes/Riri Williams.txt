When Amanda Armstrong offers to have Riri let Tony Stark's labs be her base of operations, Riri is hesitant as Pepper encourages her. The next day at her home, Riri's family is visited by the headmistress at M.I.T. who would like Riri to continue working there as it has gotten sloppy since she left. In addition, Riri will be allowed to use the laboratories there. After her work in one of the laboratories, Riri has the Tony Stark A.I. find her something to blow off some steam on.

They're later told by Black Widow that they are going to kill Steve Rogers, after Hydra attacked the Underground's hideout and destroyed it.

==Personality==
In [[grade school]], Riri had a desire to be a scientist like [[Mae Carol Jemison]]. Telling her teacher this, she was upset to learn that her teacher told her, in support, that she could grow up to be whatever she wanted. Riri had the desire of being discriminated against in an environment that is incredibly supportive. To satisfy her [[superiority complex]], she pressured her teacher to tell her what she couldn't be so she could grow up to prove her wrong. To support Riri, the teacher spontaneously replied, [[Tony Stark]].<ref>''Invincible Iron Man'' #8</ref>
