'''Steel Vengeance''' (original name '''Sadae Tsumura''') was a female cyborg in the [[Marvel Comics]] ''[[Ghost Rider (comic book)|Ghost Rider]]'' series.

==Fictional character biography==
She was the sister of [[Steel Wind (comics)|Steel Wind]] ([[Ruriko Tsumura]]) who enlisted the soulless Centurious, an enemy of [[Ghost Rider (comics)|Ghost Rider]], and his agent [[Reverend Styge]] to rehabilitate her. In exchange, they transform the sister into the cyborg Steel Vengeance, and Centurious claimed at least Steel Vengeance's soul.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

Steel Vengeance had unsuccessfully attacked [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Johnny Blaze]] and the new [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)]] in her sister's absence. Centurious had Steel Wind bonded to her cycle and sent both sisters plus the demons of [[Styge]] against the Quentin Carnival, but the demonlord [[Mephisto (Marvel Comics)|Mephisto]] interrupted the fight by teleporting away Blaze and Ghost Rider. Separated from her cycle, Steel Wind watched Centurious slay her sister for their failure, and then joined the demons of Styge against the Carnival again.{{issue|date=August 2013}}
