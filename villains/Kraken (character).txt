===Marvel characters===

====Commander Kraken====
A villain who adopted the name of [[Commander Kraken]] debuted in ''Sub-Mariner'' #27 (July 1970) and battled several of Marvel's heroes before finally being killed by [[Scourge of the Underworld]] in ''[[Captain America]]'' #319 (July 1986).

====Daniel Whitehall====
An elite assassin and member of the terrorist organization [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] also used the name and debuted in ''[[Secret Warriors (2009 series)|Secret Warriors]]'' #2, March 2009.  Writer/artist [[Jonathan Hickman]] stated in an interview with [[Comic Book Resources]] that "Kraken" is a new character. The other Hydra character with that name [Commander Kraken] was "a real b-list character and pretty lame. Our Kraken... has a long and elaborate history and we're going to be delving into that in a major way".<ref>{{cite web |author=Dave Richards |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=22548 |title=Hickman Talks "Secret Warriors" |publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] |date=August 14, 2009 |accessdate=June 29, 2011 }}</ref> Kraken, who was working at British intelligence a decade after World War II, is a legendary Hydra agent, whose existence had been unverifiable, until recently. Any S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that tried to find documented proof all disappeared. The Kraken preferred to work behind the scenes, seeing it as his mission to help people become what they are meant to be, usually with dangerous results. For decades he was responsible for developing Hydra's best assets, training their best talent. This involved a lot of human trafficking, theft, and murder. He was the head of the school that trained orphaned girls (including a young Viper) into human weapons. The current Kraken is actually the second Kraken, not Daniel Whitehall, having killed the original and stolen his identity by taking his equipment and reading his journals.<ref>''Secret Warriors #2''</ref>

It is revealed that this second Kraken is actually [[Scorpio (comics)|Jake Fury]], who had infiltrated the highest rungs of HYDRA to help his brother bring about its destruction.<ref>''Secret Warriors #26''</ref>

====Steve Roger's HYDRA Kraken====
A new Kraken is seen when the new [[Madame Hydra]] is collecting members for her HYDRA High Council to assist [[Captain America]], who's memory had been altered by Red Skull's clone using the powers of [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Kobik|Kobik]] to include him always being a member of HYDRA. It is implied this person is someone Steve Rogers knows and believes to be dead.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers #14''</ref>

====Agent Kraken====
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] imprint title ''[[Ultimate X-Men]]'' featured an "Agent Kraken", acting as a bodyguard to the [[President of the United States]].<ref>''Ultimate X-Men'' #43 (May 2004)</ref>

====Kraken artifact====
In ''Captain America & Namor'' #635.1, "Kraken" is a name given to a powerful mystical artifact created by an ancient Lemurian death cult. It was a tentacled skull mask that embued its wearer with mystical powers.

==In other media==
===Television===
* The Daniel Whitehall version of Kraken appears in [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|Season 2]] of ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', portrayed by [[Reed Diamond]]. This version, originally having the name '''Werner Reinhardt''', was a member of Hydra in 1945, prior to being arrested by [[Peggy Carter]] and the Strategic Scientific Reserve. An elderly Reinhardt was freed from life imprisonment in 1989, by Hydra infiltrators within S.H.I.E.L.D. and encounters Jiaying (an [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] woman who remained looking young after their first encounter during World War II). He dissects her to discover the secret of her abilities, resulting in her supposed death, but also in Reinhardt's de-aging back to his World War II appearance. What he didn't know is that Jiaying was married to [[Mister Hyde (comics)|Calvin Zabo]]. In the present, he started calling himself Daniel Whitehall and acted as Hydra's North American leader, following their [[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|emergence from hiding]], and leads the effort to acquire a [[Kree]] artifact called "the Diviner", which turned out to be an artifact containing Terrigen crystals. He frequently clashed with the reconstituted S.H.I.E.L.D. led by [[Phil Coulson]]. In addition, Whitehall has used [[Doctor Faustus (comics)|Johann Fenhoff]]'s hypnosis trick to brainwash Agent 33 and [[Blizzard (comics)|Donald Gill]] into serving Hydra. Whitehall was later killed by Coulson, depriving Calvin of his revenge. In the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|Season 3]] episode "Paradise Lost", Whitehall appears in a flashback where he confers with a young Gideon Malick and his brother Nathaniel, following the funeral of their father. In the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|Season 4]] episode "Let Me Stand Next to you Fire", is revealed that Whitewall was after the [[Darkhold]] at some point in his life.

* The sea creature version of Kraken appeared in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' episode "Return to the Spider-Verse" Pt. 2. This version is a giant squid that resides in an alternate cartoon pirate reality. When [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Kid Arachnid]], and Web Beard get caught by pirate versions of [[Howard the Duck]], [[Rocket Raccoon]], and [[Cosmo the Spacedog]] who had mutinied against Web Beard, they planned to have them [[Walking the plank|walk the plank]] off the [[Groot]] Pirate Ship in order to feed them to the Kraken. When the Kraken got angered upon getting hit in the eye with the debris, it attacked the Groot Pirate Ship. Spider-Man and Kid Arachnid persuaded Web Beard and the mutineers to settle their differences and help to fight the Kraken. Once that was done, they all tie up the Kraken enough for it to swim out to sea.

===Video games===
* The sea creature version of Kraken appears in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]''. It was shown locked in a pit until [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] (who was posing as [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]) released it to attack the heroes.
* King Kraken is alluded to in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' as he is seen in graffiti at the Final Offer.
